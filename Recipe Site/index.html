    <h2>Egg Fried Rice</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p> -250g long grain rice <br>
        -3 tbsp vegetable oil <br>
        -1 onion, finely chopped <br>
        -4 eggs, beaten <br>
        -2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.</p>
